Find Nth root of M
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 25.06%Submissions: 120K+Points: 2
You are given 2 numbers (n , m); the task is to find nâˆšm (nth root of m).
 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2, m = 9
Output: 3
Explanation: 32 = 9
Example 2:

Input: n = 3, m = 9
Output: -1
Explanation: 3rd root of 9 is not
integer.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anyhting. Your task is to complete the function NthRoot() which takes n and m as input parameter and returns the nth root of m. If the root is not integer then returns -1.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n* log(m))
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 30
1 <= m <= 109
