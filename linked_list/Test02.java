Count Linked List Nodes
Difficulty: BasicAccuracy: 85.99%Submissions: 181K+Points: 1
Given a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

Examples :

Input: LinkedList : 1->2->3->4->5

Output: 5
Explanation: Count of nodes in the linked list is 5, which is its length.
Input: LinkedList : 2->4->6->7->5->1->0
 
Output: 7
Explanation: Count of nodes in the linked list is 7. Hence, the output is 7.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxilliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= number of nodes <= 105
1 <= node->data <= 103
